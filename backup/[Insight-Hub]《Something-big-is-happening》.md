### What you should actually do:

1. Start using AI seriously, not just as a search engine.
付费订阅的最前沿AI模型，比免费模型要强很多（请想想现在ai发展的巨大速度）。花时间去学习AI工具，在你的日常工作中认真地使用ai。

> **This might be the most important year of your career.** Work accordingly. I don't say that to stress you out. I say it because right now, there is a **brief window** where most people at most companies are still ignoring this. The person who walks into a meeting and says "I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days" is going to be the most valuable person in the room. Not eventually. Right now. Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's possible. If you're early enough, this is how you move up: by being the person who understands what's coming and can show others how to navigate it. That window won't stay open long. Once everyone figures it out, the advantage disappears.


> Have no ego about it. The managing partner at that law firm isn't too proud to spend hours a day with AI. He's doing it specifically because he's senior enough to understand what's at stake. The people who will struggle most are the ones who refuse to engage: the ones who dismiss it as a fad, who feel that using AI diminishes their expertise, who assume their field is special and immune. It's not. **No field is.**


> Get your financial house in order. Give yourself options if things move faster than you expect.（其实我觉得马克思主义会是AI时代下，人类智慧真正应当好好考虑的事情。AI带来的难以想象的生产力可能会加速马克思预言的共产社会的来临。我们需要相关的哲学家和马克思哲学学生引导我们保证AI安全，确保我们的AI、我们的社会，准备好了。）


2.Think about where you stand, and lean into what's hardest to replace. 


 

> Some things will take longer for AI to displace. Relationships and trust built over years. Work that requires physical presence. Roles with licensed accountability: roles where someone still has to sign off, take legal responsibility, stand in a courtroom. Industries with heavy regulatory hurdles, where adoption will be slowed by compliance, liability, and institutional inertia. None of these are permanent shields. But they buy time. **And time, right now, is the most valuable thing you can have, as long as you use it to adapt, not to pretend this isn't happening.**


> Rethink what you're telling your kids. The standard playbook: get good grades, go to a good college, land a stable professional job. It points directly at the roles that are most exposed. I'm not saying education doesn't matter. But the thing that will matter most for the next generation is **learning how to work with these tools, and pursuing things they're genuinely passionate about.** Nobody knows exactly what the job market looks like in ten years. But the people most likely to thrive are the ones **who are deeply curious, adaptable, and effective at using AI to do things they actually care about.** Teach your kids to be builders and learners, not to optimize for a career path that might not exist by the time they graduate.



3. Your dreams just got a lot closer.


>  I've spent most of this section talking about threats, so let me talk about the other side, because it's just as real. If you've ever wanted to build something but didn't have the technical skills or the money to hire someone, that barrier is largely gone. You can describe an app to AI and have a working version in an hour. I'm not exaggerating. I do this regularly. If you've always wanted to write a book but couldn't find the time or struggled with the writing, you can work with AI to get it done. Want to learn a new skill? The best tutor in the world is now available to anyone for $20 a month... one that's infinitely patient, available 24/7, and can explain anything at whatever level you need. Knowledge is essentially free now. The tools to build things are extremely cheap now. Whatever you've been putting off because it felt too hard or too expensive or too far outside your expertise: try it. Pursue the things you're passionate about. You never know where they'll lead. And in a world where the old career paths are getting disrupted, the person who spent a year building something they love might end up better positioned than the person who spent that year clinging to a job description.




4. Build the habit of adapting. 

 

> **This is maybe the most important one. The specific tools don't matter as much as the muscle of learning new ones quickly. AI is going to keep changing, and fast. The models that exist today will be obsolete in a year. The workflows people build now will need to be rebuilt. The people who come out of this well won't be the ones who mastered one tool. They'll be the ones who got comfortable with the pace of change itself. Make a habit of experimenting. Try new things even when the current thing is working. Get comfortable being a beginner repeatedly. That adaptability is the closest thing to a durable advantage that exists right now.**

Amodei has a thought experiment I can't stop thinking about. Imagine it's 2027. A new country appears overnight. 50 million citizens, every one smarter than any Nobel Prize winner who has ever lived. They think 10 to 100 times faster than any human. They never sleep. They can use the internet, control robots, direct experiments, and operate anything with a digital interface. What would a national security advisor say?
